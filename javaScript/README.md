# What is JAVASCRIPT?
* It is an object-oriented programming language used to make web pages interactive.

* JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run.

# console.log()

* The console.log() method is used to log or print messages to the console. It can also be used to print objects and other info.

# Comments

* Single line [//]
* Multi-lines [/* */]

# General

* Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
* We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
* There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
* Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
* Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
* The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
* Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
* Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
* We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
* Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.

# Document Object Model (DOM)
* A tree of objects created by web browser, when a web page loads.
* The web browser uses the DOM to interpret the page and display its contents.
* Allows the elements on a web page to be dynamically changed or updated using JS or jQuery Library.

# Limitations of JavaScript
* JavaScript is a client-side language, which means it runs on the user's computer and not on the server.
* Cannot be forced onto users web browser.
* Must be supported by the web browser.
* Most browsers support JavaScript by default.
* JavaScriptis not JAVA.

# Data Types
* Numbers( any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42)
* Strings( text wrapped in quotes '' or "" )
* Arrays( list of items [])
* Objects( key-value pairs {})
